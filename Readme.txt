The next projects are only used for demo purpose, please dont distributed those.
Remember is only demo is not a professional end software.

The first demo is building using angular 6, angular material io and mvc web api 2 and other frameworks.
Handle authentication by acess token
user, groups and menus Catlogs, please ignore company.
The idea is create a dynamic menu for each user also handle authorization for each user menu via web api 2.
The web api dont handle roles because is handle dynamic authorization.

angularhost -> frontend
hostapi -> web api
database.sql -> script with all tables and data

second project is a mvc app frontend
